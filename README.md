## About

Indian food dataset is a labelled data set with different food classes. Each food class contains 1000s of images. Using the data provided, a deep learning model built on TensorFlow is trained to classify into various classes in dataset.

<br>**Epoches:** 200
<br>**Batch_size:** 32

Images are split to train and test set with 4020 images belonging to 80 different classes. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Let's preview some of the images.

The size of the images are inconsistent as shown in the height against width plot shown below, so all the images are scaled to same size, so we dont have to worry about inconsistency.

## Model
To create a convolution neural network to classfied the images, Sequential model is used.

```python
model = models.Sequential([
    resize_and_rescale,
    data_augmentation,
    layers.Conv2D(32,(3,3),activation = 'relu',input_shape = input_shape),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64,(3,3),activation = 'relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64,(3,3),activation = 'relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    layers.Conv2D(128,(3,3),activation = 'relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(256,activation = 'relu'),
    layers.Dense(n_classes,activation = 'softmax'),
])
```

## Training

Model accuracy increased over each epoch, overfitting started at around 40 epochs. The model achieved validation accuracy of **92.94%** with a 0.2418 cross entropy validation loss.

## Results Evaluation

Preview some predictions from the model:

## Conclusion

With the given data sets for 80 classes of Indian food, the model final accuracy reached 92.94% with cross entropy validation loss of 0.2418.
